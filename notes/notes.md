# Notes

## before implementing questions to ask

- ask what data are we storing
- what are the fields and their datatype
- why are we storing this data
- adding or removing a single find will change entire business logic in backend

## tools to work with mongoDb

- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is orm-like (ODM) library which handles boilerplate and work easily
- [moon modeler](https://www.datensen.com/data-modeling/moon-modeler-for-databases.html) is used to model database structure , this is paid and i do not have money to purchase it :(
- using [easer io](https://app.eraser.io/) because there is free version available
